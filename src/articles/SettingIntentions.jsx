      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
        Yoga is not just a physical practiceâ€”it's a mental and spiritual journey. One of the most powerful tools you can use to guide your yoga practice is setting an intention (also known as Sankalpa). This simple yet profound practice can provide clarity, focus, and motivation as you move through each session.

        **What is an Intention?**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        An intention is a positive affirmation or goal you set at the beginning of your practice. It's different from a resolution or a goal because it focuses on the process rather than the outcome. For example, instead of saying, "I want to master the handstand," you might set the intention: "I will embrace patience and trust my body today."

        **How to Set Your Intention**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Start by finding a comfortable seat and closing your eyes. Take a few deep breaths and tune in to how you're feeling in the moment. Then, ask yourself what you'd like to focus on in your practice. Is it patience, strength, mindfulness, or self-compassion? Your intention can be simple, but it should resonate with you on a personal level.

        **Why Set an Intention?**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Setting an intention helps you stay grounded in your practice, whether you're practicing on your mat or navigating life off the mat. It reminds you of your purpose, which can lead to a deeper connection with your body, breath, and mind. Over time, setting intentions can help you develop a more mindful and compassionate approach to your yoga journey.
