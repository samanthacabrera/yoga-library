        Breath is the foundation of yoga. It not only calms the mind but also helps guide movement and enhances your practice. For beginners, learning the basics of breathing techniques (also known as Pranayama) can significantly deepen your yoga experience. Below, we cover some of the most commonly used techniques in yoga that will help you connect with your breath and your body.

        **1. Ujjayi Breath (Victorious Breath)**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Ujjayi breath is one of the most popular breathing techniques in yoga. It involves slightly constricting the back of the throat, creating a soft, ocean-like sound as you breathe in and out through the nose. This breath helps to create focus and can generate internal heat, making it ideal for Vinyasa or Ashtanga yoga practices.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-4">
        **How to do Ujjayi Breath:**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        - Sit comfortably or lie down in a relaxed position.  
        - Inhale deeply through your nose, gently constricting your throat (like you're fogging up a mirror).  
        - Exhale through your nose, maintaining the slight constriction to create the audible sound.  
        - Focus on the sound and sensation of the breath as you continue.

        **2. Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril Breathing)**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Nadi Shodhana is a balancing and calming breath technique. It involves inhaling and exhaling through alternate nostrils, which helps clear energy channels, reduce stress, and promote mental clarity.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-4">
        **How to do Nadi Shodhana:**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        - Sit in a comfortable position with a tall spine.  
        - Using your right thumb, close your right nostril and inhale deeply through the left nostril.  
        - Close the left nostril with your right ring finger, then release the right nostril and exhale through it.  
        - Inhale through the right nostril, close it with your thumb, and exhale through the left.

        **3. Dirga Pranayama (Three-Part Breath)**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Dirga Pranayama is a simple and effective breathing technique that involves filling the lungs completely by using the abdomen, ribs, and chest in a three-part inhale. Itâ€™s great for beginners because it helps develop full awareness of the breath.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-4">
        **How to do Dirga Pranayama:**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        - Sit or lie in a comfortable position.  
        - Begin by taking a deep breath into your belly, expanding your abdomen fully.  
        - Next, allow your rib cage to expand as you inhale, filling your lungs.  
        - Finally, fill the chest with air, lifting the collarbones slightly.  
        - Exhale slowly, releasing the breath from the chest, ribs, and abdomen in that order.
