      <h1 className="text-4xl mb-4">How to Build a Daily Yoga Routine</h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
        Building a daily yoga routine can be transformative for your mind and body. It doesn’t require hours of practice each day—consistency and intentionality are the keys to success. Whether you're new to yoga or a seasoned practitioner, developing a routine that works for your lifestyle is essential for growth. Here's a guide to help you build your own daily practice.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-4">
        **1. Start with Your Intention**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Before you even step onto your mat, take a moment to set an intention. This could be a word or phrase that resonates with your goals for the day’s practice. It could be as simple as "I am present" or "I welcome calm." Setting an intention helps guide your focus and infuses your practice with meaning.

        **2. Begin with a Warm-Up**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        It’s essential to prepare your body for movement. Start with some gentle stretches or breathing exercises to increase circulation and warm up your muscles. Sun Salutations are an excellent warm-up for any level of practitioner, as they engage the entire body.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-4">
        **3. Create a Flow That Works for You**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        A simple flow can include a combination of standing poses, balance poses, seated stretches, and core strengthening exercises. A balanced routine might look like:
        - **Sun Salutations**: 5-10 rounds to warm up  
        - **Standing poses**: Warrior I, Warrior II, Triangle  
        - **Balance poses**: Tree Pose, Eagle Pose  
        - **Seated stretches**: Forward Fold, Seated Twist  
        - **Core work**: Boat Pose, Plank Pose  
        - **Cool down**: Child’s Pose, Savasana
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-4">
        **4. Listen to Your Body**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Yoga is about tuning into your body’s needs. If something feels off, modify the pose or skip it entirely. It’s okay to take breaks and rest when you need to. With time, you’ll develop a better understanding of your body’s limits and strengths.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-4">
        **5. Consistency is Key**
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-2">
        The most important aspect of building a daily yoga practice is consistency. Aim to practice for at least 15-30 minutes every day, even if it’s just a quick flow or a few stretches. Over time, your flexibility, strength, and mindfulness will grow.
