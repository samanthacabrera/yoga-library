    "precaution": "If you have any lower back or neck issues, be sure to keep your spine in alignment by gently engaging your core muscles to prevent overarching. Avoid locking your knees, and instead, keep them slightly soft to prevent hyperextension. As with any yoga pose, listen to your body, and if you experience discomfort or pain, ease out of the pose and consult a healthcare provider if needed. "

    "precaution": " Individuals with wrist issues should avoid excessive weight on the wrists, ensuring the fingers are spread wide and the weight is distributed evenly across the palms. For those with shoulder concerns, the shoulders should be engaged by pressing the shoulder blades down the back to prevent any unnecessary strain. The neck should remain in a neutral position, with the gaze directed between the legs or at the belly button. Avoid dropping or craning the neck, as this can cause tension in the cervical spine. Pregnant individuals should avoid Downward Dog, particularly after the first trimester, as the inversion may place pressure on the abdomen and disrupt circulation. People with pre-existing injuries to the back, neck, or shoulders should modify the pose."

    "precaution": "If you have wrist or shoulder injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, or rotator cuff issues, you should approach Plank Pose with caution, as the weight-bearing nature of the pose can aggravate these conditions. If you experience lower back pain, ensure your core is properly engaged and your alignment is correct to avoid sagging in the lower back, which could worsen discomfort. Pregnant individuals, especially in the later stages, should avoid Plank Pose due to the pressure it places on the abdomen and lower back, and instead consider gentler alternatives like a wall plank."

    "precaution": "Those with lower back issues should be cautious, as overextending the lower back can lead to strain. It’s important to engage the core muscles and lift the chest rather than collapsing in the lower back. Individuals with wrist sensitivity should be mindful of the pressure on the wrists in this pose. For those with shoulder injuries or limited flexibility, it’s crucial to avoid collapsing the shoulders forward. Keep the shoulders away from the ears, draw the shoulder blades down, and ensure the elbows are not locked. Additionally, maintaining proper neck alignment is essential to prevent strain—avoid craning the neck backward too far and keep it in a neutral position. Pregnant individuals, especially in later stages, should avoid this pose due to the pressure it places on the abdomen and lower back. It is also important for those with spinal conditions, such as herniated discs or scoliosis, to consult a healthcare provider before attempting the pose."

    "precaution": "While Child's Pose (Balasana) is generally a gentle and restorative pose, there are some precautions to keep in mind to ensure a safe and effective practice. If you have knee injuries or discomfort, you may want to place a cushion or blanket under your knees for added support and cushioning. For those with lower back pain, it is important to avoid collapsing the lower back or forcing the torso down too far; instead, focus on gently lengthening the spine while keeping the hips aligned over the knees. If you are pregnant, especially in later stages, it's advised to modify the pose by keeping the knees slightly apart to avoid pressure on the belly or chest."

Those with hip or lower back pain should avoid forcing the hips to square completely forward, as this can cause discomfort or misalignment; instead, they can allow a slight external rotation of the back hip. For practitioners with shoulder injuries or limited mobility, the arms can be kept parallel to the ground or placed on the hips instead of being raised overhead."

Those with tight hips or hamstrings should avoid overextending the legs and may need to reduce the depth of the lunge to prevent discomfort or injury. If you have lower back issues, it’s important to be mindful of your hip alignment, ensuring that your hips are open and facing to the side rather than forward, as improper alignment can strain the lower back. Individuals with shoulder problems should avoid lifting the shoulders up toward the ears and focus on relaxing them down to reduce tension. Pregnant individuals or those with balance concerns should modify the pose by shortening their stance or using props for additional support."
