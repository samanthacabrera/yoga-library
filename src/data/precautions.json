Using a folded blanket under the shoulders can create additional support and reduce strain on the neck. Avoid turning the head while in the pose, as this can compromise spinal alignment. Those with high blood pressure, glaucoma, or other eye and ear conditions should consult with a healthcare professional before attempting Halasana, as the inversion may increase pressure in these areas. Pregnant individuals and those with conditions like herniated discs, sciatica, or osteoporosis should also avoid the pose unless guided by an experienced instructor."

    "name": "Dancer Pose",
    "precaution": "Those with a history of ankle, knee, or hip injuries should be especially careful, as the posture requires significant balance and engagement of the lower body. People with back issues, particularly in the lower back or spine, should avoid deep backbends or seek modifications to prevent strain. Additionally, those with shoulder injuries may find the arm extension in Dancer Pose challenging, as it requires opening the chest and reaching the arm forward while stabilizing the back. Pregnant individuals, especially in the later stages, may want to avoid the intense backbend or deep stretch in this pose, opting for a gentler variation. It’s also important for beginners to approach Dancer Pose gradually, ensuring proper alignment and avoiding overstretching, as falling or straining in the pose can lead to injury."

    "name": "Bow Pose",
    "precaution": "Those with existing back injuries, chronic lower back pain, or spinal conditions such as herniated discs should avoid this pose or practice it under the guidance of a qualified instructor. Similarly, individuals with recent abdominal surgeries or conditions like ulcers, hernias, or severe digestive issues should refrain from practicing Bow Pose, as the intense abdominal stretch may exacerbate these conditions. Pregnant individuals should also avoid this posture, as it compresses the abdomen. Additionally, those with shoulder or neck injuries, high blood pressure, or migraines should exercise care or modify the pose to suit their needs."

    "name": "Wheel Pose",
    "precaution": "Those with back or spinal issues, such as herniated discs, scoliosis, or sacral instability, should be particularly cautious, as the deep backbend can exacerbate these conditions. Individuals with neck or shoulder injuries may also be at risk due to the significant strain placed on these areas during the pose. Those with limited flexibility in the shoulders, hips, or wrists should take care, as these areas are heavily engaged in maintaining the posture. People with high blood pressure or heart conditions should also be mindful, as the inversion and lifting of the chest can increase circulation to the upper body. Additionally, pregnant individuals, especially in later stages, should avoid Wheel Pose due to the pressure it places on the abdomen. As a physically demanding pose, Wheel Pose requires proper alignment and strength, so individuals new to yoga or those with limited flexibility should be cautious when attempting it."
