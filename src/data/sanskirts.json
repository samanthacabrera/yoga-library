    "name": "Mountain Pose",
    "sanskrit_name" : "ताड़ासन",
    "translation": "Tadasana",
    "context": "The etymology of Tāḍāsana comes from two Sanskrit words: Tāḍa (ताड), meaning 'mountain,' and Āsana (आसन), meaning 'posture' or 'seat.' The term Tāḍa symbolizes the solid, stable, and grounded nature of a mountain, which reflects the strength and steadiness that the pose embodies. Āsana is a common Sanskrit word used in yoga to refer to any posture. Together, Tāḍāsana translates to 'Mountain Pose,' a standing posture that emphasizes physical strength, stability, and alignment, akin to the solid foundation of a mountain. It's alternate name, Samasthitiḥ, refers to 'equal standing' or 'balanced position,' further emphasizing the balance and centeredness that the pose cultivates. Historically, Tāḍāsana did not appear in traditional Hatha Yoga texts but is mentioned in the 1896 Vyayama Dipika, a manual of gymnastics. The pose became a foundational element in modern yoga through the teachings of Krishnamacharya, who incorporated it into the practice of Vinyasa Yoga. His students, Pattabhi Jois and B.K.S. Iyengar, further popularized Tāḍāsana in their respective yoga styles, Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga and Iyengar Yoga, where it remains a key posture."

Thus, the name translates to 'Downward-Facing Dog Pose,' evoking the image of a dog stretching its body with its front legs extended and hips raised. This pose mimics the natural stance of a dog stretching after waking, embodying qualities of flexibility, strength, and openness. Historically, Adho Mukha Svanasana has been a core part of yoga practice, appearing in various forms in traditional texts such as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika. It gained further prominence in modern yoga through the teachings of T. Krishnamacharya and his students, including Pattabhi Jois and B.K.S.

The pose is rooted in traditional yoga practices and has been used for centuries to build core strength, stability, and endurance. While it may not appear in the earliest texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, variations of the pose have long been included in strength-building sequences and as part of dynamic physical practices. Plank Pose has gained popularity in modern yoga, particularly in Vinyasa and Power Yoga, where it is often integrated into sun salutations or used as a transition between postures. It became more widely recognized as yoga evolved in the 20th century, especially through the teachings of influential yoga masters like T. Krishnamacharya, Pattabhi Jois, and B.K.S. Iyengar, who emphasized the importance of building strength and stability in the body. Today, Plank Pose is considered a foundational posture in many yoga practices, valued for its ability to engage the entire body and enhance both physical and mental endurance."
