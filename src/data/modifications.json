    "modification": "For those with ankle or knee issues, widening the stance by separating the feet a few inches can provide extra stability and reduce strain. If balance is a concern, standing near a wall or using a block under your feet for support can help maintain the pose with more confidence. For practitioners with shoulder tension or limited mobility, keeping the arms by the sides or placing the palms facing inward rather than reaching upwards can help alleviate discomfort."

    "modification": "For individuals with tight hamstrings or calves, keeping the knees bent can prevent overstraining the legs and lower back. This modification helps maintain a long, neutral spine, avoiding rounding in the back, and allows the body to relax into the stretch more comfortably. It also ensures that the core remains engaged without creating excessive tension in the lower back or hamstrings. If reaching the heels to the floor is difficult, using props like blocks or cushions under the feet can provide support. Elevating the heels allows practitioners to focus on lifting the hips and lengthening the spine rather than forcing the heels down, which can lead to unnecessary strain. For those with wrist discomfort or injuries, instead of pressing directly into the palms, practitioners can make fists, use a yoga block under the hands, or try a forearm variation of the pose. These adjustments reduce pressure on the wrists while still engaging the shoulders and core. Using a wedge-shaped block to elevate the hands slightly can also provide additional support and ease strain on the wrists."

    "name": "Plank Pose",
    "modification": "One simple modification is to perform the pose on your forearms instead of your hands, known as Forearm Plank. This reduces the pressure on the wrists and can help you maintain better alignment in the shoulders. If you still find it difficult to maintain the pose, try lowering your knees to the ground. This modification lightens the load on the core and helps you focus on building strength gradually without compromising form. Using props such as yoga blocks under the hands or a cushion under the knees can further reduce strain and provide more support during the hold. Another accessible option is to perform a wall plank by placing your hands on a wall at shoulder height and stepping your feet back until your body forms an angled line. This variation eliminates pressure on the wrists and shoulders while still engaging the core and promoting proper alignment. Additionally, you can reduce the duration of the hold, working up to longer times as you build strength and endurance. By adjusting the pose to fit your bodyâ€™s needs, you can still enjoy the benefits of Plank Pose while minimizing the risk of injury."

    "modification": "If the backbend feels too intense or if there's lower back discomfort, you can also perform a gentler version by keeping the thighs on the mat, creating a variation called Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana), which still engages the upper back and chest but with less strain on the lower spine. For those with tight hips or lower back concerns, placing the knees on the mat can help by taking some pressure off the lower body while still allowing the chest and upper body to lift."

    "modification": "If you have knee discomfort or injury, placing a cushion or blanket under the knees can provide additional support. You can also try keeping the knees slightly apart, rather than together, to reduce pressure on the knees and make the pose more comfortable. If you experience tightness in the hips or lower back, using a bolster or pillow between your legs or under your chest can help support the body and promote a deeper, more restorative stretch. For individuals with neck discomfort, placing a small cushion under the forehead or using a block to elevate the head can prevent strain and allow for a more relaxed position. Additionally, if the full forward bend is difficult, you can modify the pose by simply sitting on the heels with a slight lean forward, keeping the chest lifted to avoid excess pressure on the back."
