    "sanskrit_name" : "ताड़ासन",
    "translation": "Tadasana",
    "context": "The etymology of Tāḍāsana comes from two Sanskrit words: Tāḍa (ताड), meaning 'mountain,' and Āsana (आसन), meaning 'posture' or 'seat.' The term Tāḍa symbolizes the solid, stable, and grounded nature of a mountain, which reflects the strength and steadiness that the pose embodies. Āsana is a common Sanskrit word used in yoga to refer to any posture. Together, Tāḍāsana translates to 'Mountain Pose,' a standing posture that emphasizes physical strength, stability, and alignment, akin to the solid foundation of a mountain. It's alternate name, Samasthitiḥ, refers to 'equal standing' or 'balanced position,' further emphasizing the balance and centeredness that the pose cultivates. Historically, Tāḍāsana did not appear in traditional Hatha Yoga texts but is mentioned in the 1896 Vyayama Dipika, a manual of gymnastics. The pose became a foundational element in modern yoga through the teachings of Krishnamacharya, who incorporated it into the practice of Vinyasa Yoga. His students, Pattabhi Jois and B.K.S. Iyengar, further popularized Tāḍāsana in their respective yoga styles, Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga and Iyengar Yoga, where it remains a key posture."

The pose evokes the imagery of the moon's gentle, curved shape, representing balance, harmony, and tranquility. Over time, the shape and flow of the pose evolved, particularly through the integration of breath and movement, which led to the more dynamic High Lunge in modern yoga. High Lunge (Utthita Ashwa Sanchalanasana) shares similarities with Ashta Chandrasana, especially in the way it engages the legs and hips, but with a more pronounced deep lunge and a focus on strength and stability. In this evolution, the alignment of the body became more focused on lengthening the spine and building core strength, leading to the pose we recognize today.

Together, Urdhva Prasarita Eka Padasana translates to 'Upward Extended One-Legged Pose,' referring to the posture where one leg is extended upward while the body remains standing. While this pose is not an exact match for the commonly practiced standing splits pose, it is the closest translation in Sanskrit for a similar movement. In standing splits, the torso folds forward toward the extended leg, whereas Urdhva Prasarita Eka Padasana typically involves a more upright torso with the leg extending vertically.
