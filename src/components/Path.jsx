While yoga can enhance physical strength, flexibility, and mental calm, its true value extends beyond the physical practice, influencing how we live and behave in everyday life.",

        "A complete Pranayama cycle includes: Rechaka (exhalation), Bahya Kumbhaka (pause after exhalation), Puraka (inhalation), and Antara Kumbhaka (pause after inhalation).",
