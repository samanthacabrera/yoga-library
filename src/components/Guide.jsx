            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl text-center mb-2">Common Terms in Yoga</h2>
            <ul className="list-inside space-y-4 tracking-wide text-sm sm:text-base">
                <li>
                    <strong>Asana: </strong> 
                    Asana refers to the physical postures or poses in yoga. Each asana is designed to stretch, strengthen, or relax different parts of the body. Asanas are fundamental in yoga practice, creating a balance between strength, flexibility, and body awareness. They can vary from basic seated poses to more complex inversions and balances. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pranayama: </strong> 
                    Pranayama is the practice of breath control. It involves techniques that regulate the breath to increase energy (prana) in the body and calm the nervous system. Through controlled inhalation, exhalation, and retention of breath, pranayama can improve mental clarity, focus, and emotional balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chakra: </strong> 
                    Chakras are energy centers within the body that are believed to influence various physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of life. There are seven main chakras, each located along the spine and associated with different colors, elements, and functions. The continual act of balancing and unblocking chakras can help promote overall well-being.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Drishti: </strong> 
                    Drishti is a focused gaze or point of concentration that helps practitioners achieve better balance and awareness in their poses. It is an important tool for improving concentration and cultivating a meditative state during practice. Each asana has a recommended drishti point, which may be toward a physical object, a spot on the floor, or even internally toward a part of the body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mantra: </strong> 
                    A mantra is a word, sound, or phrase that is repeated during meditation to help focus the mind and evoke a specific state of consciousness. It can be a sacred syllable like "Om" or a more complex affirmation. The repetition of a mantra helps reduce mental distractions, creating a deeper connection with the self and promoting mindfulness.

        <p>
            Props are an essential part of yoga, especially for beginners. They help with alignment, provide support, and make postures more accessible. Using props doesn't mean you're less skilled—it means you're practicing safely and effectively.

                    <strong>Yoga Blocks: </strong> 
                    These provide support in standing and seated poses by bringing the floor closer to you. They help with balance, alignment, and deepening stretches.

                    <strong>Bolsters: </strong>

                    <strong>Wall & Chair: </strong>

        <p>While yoga props can be helpful, it’s important to know that you don’t always need to buy expensive equipment to practice yoga. In fact, you can often use items you already have around your house. For instance, a thick,sturdy book can substitute for a yoga block, or a towel can serve as a yoga strap.</p>
        
        {/* Benefits of Yoga */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium text-charcoal tracking-wide">
            Benefits of Consistent Yoga Practice
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
           Yoga is more than just movement—it’s a transformative practice that enhances physical health, mental clarity, and emotional balance. Committing to a regular yoga routine creates lasting benefits that extend beyond the mat and into daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yoga’s impact is far-reaching, offering advantages for both the body and mind. By practicing yoga regularly, individuals can experience improvements in their physical health as well as their mental and emotional state. Let’s explore these benefits in greater detail.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-medium tracking-wider">Physical Benefits</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most noticeable effects of yoga is an improvement in flexibility. Through various poses, yoga increases the range of motion in the joints and helps alleviate muscle stiffness. This improvement in flexibility is often accompanied by increased strength. Many yoga poses involve weight-bearing actions that build muscle tone and endurance, leading to a more resilient and stronger body. Moreover, yoga strengthens the core muscles, which in turn improves posture, reduces back pain, and prevents strain on the joints. Consistent practice of yoga also supports joint health by encouraging fluid movement, reducing inflammation, and promoting better circulation. As a result, the cardiovascular system benefits from enhanced blood flow, leading to improved heart health.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-medium tracking-wider">Mental & Emotional Benefits</h3>
        <p>
            Yoga is not only beneficial for the body, but it also has profound effects on the mind. One of the primary mental health benefits of yoga is stress reduction. Through controlled breathing and mindfulness, yoga helps lower cortisol levels, promoting a state of relaxation. This relaxed state also improves mental clarity and focus, allowing practitioners to concentrate more effectively both on and off the mat. Additionally, yoga encourages emotional balance by helping individuals manage stress, anxiety, and mood swings. The practice of mindfulness cultivates self-awareness, which leads to a greater sense of self-acceptance and emotional stability. Another benefit of yoga is its ability to improve sleep quality. By relaxing the body and calming the mind, yoga helps facilitate deeper and more restorative sleep, allowing practitioners to feel more rested and energized.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-medium tracking-wider">Integrating Yoga Into Daily Life</h3>
        <p>
            The advantages of yoga are not confined to the practice sessions themselves. As practitioners develop a deeper understanding of their bodies and minds, they often notice improvements in their daily lives. Yoga promotes improved sleep, better energy levels, and an overall sense of well-being. The mindfulness cultivated during yoga practice carries over into everyday activities, leading to more intentional and mindful choices. By fostering self-awareness, yoga encourages individuals to adopt healthier habits, both physically and mentally. This integration of yoga into daily life helps individuals maintain a consistent sense of balance, ensuring that the benefits of the practice continue to support them long after their yoga sessions have ended.
